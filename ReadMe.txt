ASP.NET Web Forms - How to create and use User Controls



With that programm i show how to create and use User Controls.

Firstly i have created my own User Control CalendarUserControl.ascx. That is a simple textBox with an image. 
When i press the image a Calaendar Control pops up and when i choose a date i can see the date in my text box.

Secondly i use that User Control. I pick up the date of the Calendar User Control and i show the date to an extra label by pressing a button. Do to that i also declare the user Control in the Web.config file.
